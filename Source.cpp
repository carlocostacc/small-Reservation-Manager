/*
You must enforce encapsulation by keeping all data members private.

Person, Passenger and Reservation Request objects should be created using dynamic memory allocation and the objects that are not needed anymore should be deleted. There should be an output statement confirming the deletion of an object from the destructor function.

In the implemented member functions the relevant data members should be updated.

You need to make sure that your classes are well defined using the various concepts seen in the class including constant member functions, static members, inline functions, etc

/*
for the printing of variables of the classes use the function get

/*
A member function that processes a reservation request received as
a parameter. Reservation will be successful, if seats are available for 
all the passengers in the group for the entire trip. If reservation is 
successfuI it should return reservation request number otherwise zero. 
If reservation is successful, reservation object should be inserted to 
the reservation request array. If reservation is successful, you should 
check if this passenger is on the passenger array, if not passenger 
should be stored in this array. The reservation number should be added 
to the passenger object
